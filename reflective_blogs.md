#### *Website Norms: Then and Now*

<p>Using the Wayback Machine, I viewed the Amazon website from 2006. The differences between the older version of the site and the current one are blatantly clear, with the most distinct being the overall interface of the landing page. The older website featured a visually cluttered homepage that placed less emphasis on ease of navigation and more on presenting a high volume of information at once. Images were smaller and more sparse, with products advertised using simple hyperlinks attached to their names. Additionally, much of the text on the page lacked clear contrast, showing only subtle variations in size or color.</p>

Conversely, the current website presents clear and distinct categories on the homepage, making it easier for users to navigate to different areas of the site. Text size and style for headings, subheadings, and body text follow a cohesive yet clearly contrasted structure, creating a uniform interface. Although it can be somewhat visually overwhelming due to the large number of graphics and photos on the page, they are mostly presented in an organized and easy-to-navigate manner.
  
#### *A Difference in Functionality*

<p>While the older version of Amazon was generally functional, its format was practical to a fault and lacked the visually appealing nature that has become a necessity for modern websites. Although I wouldnâ€™t call the appearance of older websites necessarily jarring, I would say that their antiquity is immediately obvious to the average internet user. Personally, I find something charming about the straightforward nature of the older Amazon website, though I can certainly appreciate how its design has improved over the last two decades.</p>

As a modern internet user, I think the most interesting part of visiting an older version of the Amazon website is how navigation-focused it is, with an endless wall of categories and hyperlinks to match. The website now feels much less cluttered in comparison and places a greater emphasis on actually displaying pictures of products, many of which are suggested based on your browsing. In today's world, websites are expected to be both functional and aesthetically appealing, so when they deviate from this, I think it can completely bar people from using them at all.
