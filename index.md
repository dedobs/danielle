# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello! My name is Danielle, I am an English Technical Communications major at UCF who is also minoring in Legal Studies. 

## Academic and Work Experience
I served as the General Editor for a technical style guide in my Documentation and Project Management class, where I collaborated with peers to create a user-friendly, comprehensive guide. This role involved developing a project style sheet, managing editorial processes, and ensuring consistency in content and style. I also have experience creating a user manual and drafting a grant proposal.
