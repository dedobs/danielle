## About Me 
Hello! My name is Danielle, I am majoring in English Technical Communications and minoring in Legal Studies at UCF. Following the completion of my degree, I hope to work in grant or contract writing either for a non-profit or within the legal field. 

## Work and Academic Experience

I have worked within the hospitality/restaurant industry for 7 years as a barsita and server. This experience has aided in the development of customer service, multitasking, and time management skills.

In terms of technical writing experience, I served as the General Editor for a technical style guide where I collaborated with peers to create a user-friendly, comprehensive guide tobe utilized by students. This role involved developing a project style sheet, managing editorial processes, and ensuring consistency in content and style. Prior experience also includes creating a user manual, drafting a grant proposal, as well as creating both legal and project memorandums.
